Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data
It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence
 Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so
Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks
